# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daryl!

I'm a final year student in Singapore Management University, specializing in full-stack development, with a preference for frontend. Outside of coding, I enjoy calisthenics, watching educational content, and asking my pet betta fish for relationship advice

## What's up
- I'm currently working on my new [portfolio](https://darylchua.vercel.app/) whilst picking up new skills along the way!
- I found out about [raycast](https://raycast.com) and I really really want to contribute. Mac users should check it out!!
- I'll be taking a language for a school module, so say hi in Spanish!

## What's really up
- I'm quite proud of a [receipt calculator](https://receipt-calculator.vercel.app) I built as a personal project to solve ***who pays who how much*** after dinner when some people share some items while some don't. (*It's not much but I'm hoping to refactor and make it more robust soon as it was built in 2021 ðŸ˜Š*)
- I'm not the best at DSA but I'm doing my best because I'm graduating soon. Someone show me how to reverse a linked list ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­
